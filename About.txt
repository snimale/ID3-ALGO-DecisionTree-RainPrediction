in this project i made use of ID3 Decision Tree algorithm to create a decision tree from the weather data of first 10 days (1-10th of) Feb, 2023 and used the so formed decision tree to predict the Rainfall status of the next 18 days (11-28th of Feb). (The decision tree is static, since i used this project for algorithm learning purpose, but can be implemented in dynamic way so it can keep improving the decision tree on its own)

location of Weather data -> Pune, Maharastra
(rainfall my varry from place to place but, in this project rainfall is considered only in the place where the parameters data was sensed)

The parameters and their ranges used in decision tree includes ->
Wind speed - low (<=5km/hr) / high (>5km/hr)
Pressure - low (<=1010 bar) /moderate (>1010 && <1017 bar) /high (>=1017 bar)
Temperature - low (<=18C) / moderate (>18C && <=30C) / high (>30C)
Humidity - veryLow (<30%) / low (>=30% && <60%) / moderate (>=60% && <80%) / high (>=80%)

results ->

82.20% -> Correct Prediction
17.80% -> Incorrect Prediction

91.47% -> Predictable Input
8.53 -> Unpredictable Input
