Sure, here's a general guideline for atmospheric pressure ranges in millibars (mbar) and their corresponding classifications:

High pressure: typically ranges from 1017 mbar to 1033 mbar. This is associated with clear, dry weather conditions and often brings with it cooler temperatures.

Low pressure: typically ranges from 980 mbar to 1010 mbar. This is associated with cloudy, rainy, or stormy weather conditions and often brings with it warmer temperatures.

Moderate pressure: typically ranges from 1011 mbar to 1016 mbar. This is associated with generally stable weather conditions, neither too hot nor too cold, and typically brings fair weather.

Please note that these ranges can vary depending on the region, season, and other factors. Additionally, it's important to keep in mind that weather patterns are complex and can't be fully explained by atmospheric pressure alone.
